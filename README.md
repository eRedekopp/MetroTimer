# MetroTimer

### What is MetroTimer?

MetroTimer is a metronome and a timer. It's simple. It's lightweight. It works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and anything
else that can run JavaFX. It doesn't have annoying ads or a million extra features that you were never going to use 
anyway.

This should absolutely already exist but somehow doesn't, at least not for MacOS Catalina.

### What still needs doing?

The UI could probably use some brushing up, and there should be a volume slider.

I still need to implement the alarm for the timer, and make the timer loop. Also, it wasn't making any sound on my 
Linux machine last I checked. Look into that...

### How do I download it?

Once it's complete I will include a standalone executable that you can download individually. For now you'll have to
clone this repo and build it from source.
