# MetroTimer

### What is MetroTimer?

MetroTimer is a metronome and a timer. It's simple. It's lightweight. It works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and anything
else that can run JavaFX. It doesn't have annoying ads or a million extra features that you were never going to use 
anyway.

### How do I download it?

Once it's complete I will include a standalone executable that you can download individually. For now you'll have to
clone this repo and build it from source.

### Will you be adding any new features?

Only ones that I find useful. Feel free to submit a pull request if you've added something interesting.

#####Features to be added:

- Tap tempo
- Allow the user to change "beep" tones
