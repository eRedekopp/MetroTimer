# MetroTimer

### What is MetroTimer?

MetroTimer is a metronome and a timer. It's simple. It's lightweight. It works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and anything
else that can run JavaFX. It doesn't have annoying ads or a million extra features that you were never going to use 
anyway.

### What still needs doing?

- Make the timer loop
- Allow the user to change "beep" tones
- Make sure the metronome is accurate
- Make sure the timer is accurate
- Add a picture of the UI to this Readme
- Make an executable

### How do I download it?

Once it's complete I will include a standalone executable that you can download individually. For now you'll have to
clone this repo and build it from source.
